Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.
Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

the key is that we are saving the 
frequencies progressively .ei for a specific Key => when it has value 2,
we add +2 to ans, then when it become value 4, we add +2 to ans and so on
