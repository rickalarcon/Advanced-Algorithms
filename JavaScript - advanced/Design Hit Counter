/*
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume 
that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically
increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.
It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

//First solution
class HitCounter {
    constructor() {
        this.hits = [];
    }
    hit = (t) => this.hits.push(t)
    getHits = (t) => this.hits.filter(h => t - h < 300).length
}

//Second Solution
var HitCounter = function() {
    this.hits = [];
};

/**
 * Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). 
 * @param {number} timestamp
 * @return {void}
 */
HitCounter.prototype.hit = function(timestamp) {
        this.hits.push(timestamp);

};

/**
 * Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). 
 * @param {number} timestamp
 * @return {number}
 */
HitCounter.prototype.getHits = function(timestamp) {
  
     var i = 0;
        while (this.hits[i] < timestamp-299) {// last 5 minutes
            this.hits.shift();
        }
        return this.hits.length;
