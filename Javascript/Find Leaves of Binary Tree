//Idea:
// From observation, we can see that nodes with the same height will be cut together. In addition, we will be cutting from height 0, to the top.
//parent value position will be determined based on the height level its children was placed.

var findLeaves = function(root) {
    if(!root) return [];
    let ans = [];
    trim(root);
    return ans;
    
    function trim(node) {

                                    // first leaft we be height=0 then its parents will be in heighter = 1 and so on. in that process we add to the ans=[[4,5,3],[2],..]
        const left = trim(node.left);
        const right = trim(node.right);
        const height = Math.max(left, right) + 1;
