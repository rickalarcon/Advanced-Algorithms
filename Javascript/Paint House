/*
The 1st row is the prices for the 1st house, we can change the matrix to present sum of prices from the 2nd row. i.e, the costs[1][0] represent minimum price to paint the second house red plus the 1st house.
Idea:
1)in the for loop : we start from second element (index 1) and start accumulating the total cost for each color & considering that the prev element color is different as well!
2)return the min Total cost of the last element!
