/*
IDEA: Using BFS with a queue!

This is actually the question of finding shortest path beween source and distnation in a 2D-array.
Instead of moving on 4 direactions, we need to move to 8 directions for this question.
C_i and C_i + 1 are different and share an edge or corner

We need keep traking cells that have been visited. Usually we can create a same size 2D-array to mark visited cell, for this question, however, it didn't mention that we can't modifiy original 2D-array, so we can just flip 0 to 1 to mark it as visited.

we keep checking the queue till we return dist or its empty
